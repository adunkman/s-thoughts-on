# Thoughts on [The Double Diamond](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/double-diamond)

## Understand

> The journey begins with a trigger. This could be an idea, some insight, a change  in the market, a macro economic change.

I think many folks stop here — they believe that their insight is the same as understanding, and don’t do any research and jump ahead.

## Define

> From a place of some understanding, we begin to synthesise knowledge into insight. … We assess the viability and impact of our plans, and determine how to measure success.

Measuring success is something that I think is often overlooked, too — before beginning, what do we need to measure so we can know if we’re successful later?

> Instead, the focus should be on the desired outcomes or impact to achieve.

This is key — and like 90% of my job right now (changing software contracts from deliverables-based to outcomes-based). Desired outcomes rarely change over time as you learn more about a problem space, because they’re rooted in user needs.

## Explore

> We know what to achieve, and by exploring and validating options, we find the best ways to succeed.

Again something that seems often overlooked — if you try only one option, you’ll think it’s always the best option and will have misplaced confidence.

## Create

> The opportunity here is two-fold. First, a working solution delivered to market. Second, we gather real market feedback.

What’s interesting about this process to me is that it comes across as waterfall-y — but really it’s not in my opinion. It’s quite agile — it’s all about finding and testing information in the fastest possible way, which is rarely writing software.
